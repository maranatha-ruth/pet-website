        h1> fictional Cat</h1>  
<p>cat is the a good animal used in home for caching little animal like mouse
and about its favorite it like milk more than anything! and Because 
cats are such smart, sentient creatures, they can have a long list of likes 
(and, perhaps, an equally long list of dislikes!) In most cases, 
the things your cat loves are the very same things you loveâ€”like 
fresh, tasty food, long naps in cozy spots, and plenty of fun </p>
